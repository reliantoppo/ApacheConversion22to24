# ApacheConversion22to24
Upgrading from source built 2.2.23 to source built 2.4.29 (OpenSSL 1.0.2n)

TODO:
+ Add vhost.conf & vhost-ssl-enabled.conf to repository and update "ApacheConversion_22to24.sh" to pull files down.
- Once they are in the repository, we can simply make a file for each environment, and skip a lot of the sed search and replaces.

+ Add additional documentation.

+Perhaps automate the various components source builds, and putting them in place under ~/httpd24/srclib/
